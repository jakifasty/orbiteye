# Design meating

## Problems we want to solve (things we should not do)
1. Overcrowd "earth"
2. Overcrowd filtering areas
3. Fitlers we did not understand
4. Laggy (not a priority at this point)
5. Not have an explorative experiance
6. Not so beutiful (we want pleasing and friendly design)
7. have to much information on on a view (ex. having a view in the view)
8. Higlighting/choosing too small objects, makes it difficult to know what you are choosing
9. Show to much details that are not necessery
10. Rule of three clicks 
11. Dropdowns of more than 5 subsections

## Things we should think about
1. How do we visualze the satelite during a period of time? Should we show position (then when)? Or only orbit? 
   1. Show the trail of the satelite? 
   2. Show how many ways around earth it has gone during the period
2. Lots of words - and somw we don't know what they mean
   1. We can use icons, but be carful with having icons that can confuse
3. Show amount of satellites? Should we do it,  or does it overcrowed the view?
   1. Debris - might be interesting with numbers. We dont have lots of information there, so does not overcrowed the view
4. Explain waht diffrent words mean - ex those used in the filter
   1. By image or by words or anything else?
5. How should we select obits/statellites? 
6. Show when loading data to give feedback on that everything is working in the background
   1. Maybe have a tutorial while you are looking at the loading side
